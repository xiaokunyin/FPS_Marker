Lead Rush a specially developed FPS game, was used to conduct this study. The game was designed to operate at extremely high framerates (up to 1500 Hz), with comprehensive logging systems to capture various performance metrics. The experiment involved various framerate settings and collected data on various performance metrics such as player accuracy, score and headshot among others. The experiment had multiple sessions, each consisting of rounds with different framerates. The game also collected a playability rating after each round.

The gameplay of Lead Rush is straightforward. Players face a single type of enemy that charges at them from various preset spawn points on the map. At any given time, 1 enemy can be on the level. Players are eliminated upon contact with an enemy but respawn with a reset of enemies. The primary goal is to eliminate as many enemies as possible without being eliminated. Elimination of enemies requires precise shooting, five shots to eliminate. The game enhances situational awareness through visual cues, such as flashing yellow bars that indicate the proximity and direction of the nearest enemy, and through auditory feedback that varies with actions like hits and kills.
